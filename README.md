# tracker-application-server
This is a Restful server created with Spring Boot &amp; MySql Database to store the GPS locations for different user ids and to also retrieve them.
I actually implemented this to store the GPS locations of my family members by updating it through a service in their smart phone &amp; to get their seek their location to the mobile application in my phone.
If you ask the question why, I have to be little bit dramatic. It's to find them if someone accidently kidnap them.
Anyway, please feel free to use this as it is or with improvements in your implementations.
